Designed and implemented a Reinforcement Learning Algorithm using Dynamic Programming that can find the shortest paths from multiple start and end points. It outputs an optimal policy which tells the best possible action in a grid environment, for any given grid configuration. The algorithm can compute the optimal policy for both deterministic and stochastic transition probability matrix. This project was done as a part of my academic curriculum for the Reinforcement Learning course.
